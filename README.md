Restaurant app for building burgers

This app will on the front end, take in your burger creations and list them to the left of the page with a interactive "Devour It" button. When you click on the Devour It button it will move the burger you ate to a list on the right. On the back end, it is pulling the data and updating a MySQL database for every entry. The app is deployed to Heroku. 

( I am still finishing up a few parts in this.....more to come)
